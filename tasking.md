<h1>Requirement</h1>
<ol>
<li>Let all the students stand in one line and everyone counts off in order.</li>

<li>During counting off, if the number is the multiples of the first special number, 
number three (3), then the student should say Fizz; if the number is the multiples of the second special number, 
number five (5), say Buzz; if the multiples of the third special number, number seven (7), say Whizz.</li>

<li>During counting off, if the number is the multiples of two special numbers, eg. the first and second numbers,
 then a student should say FizzBuzz instead of this number, so on and so forth. If the number is the multiples of three special numbers, say FizzBuzzWhizz.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Tasking</h1>
<ol>
<li>Output Fizz when special number is 3</li>
<li>Output Buzz when special number is 5</li>
<li>Output Whizz when special number is 7</li>
<li>Concatenate output if number satisfies more than one special number</li>
<li>Create a test case for logic of FizzBuzzWhizz</li>
</ol>
